Many factors constrain this, from the cost of running applications to the fundamental performance limitations of existing blockchains. We believe that new technologies can unlock a new class of real-time applications that normally must be built on Web2 foundations. Enabling these systems to be built on-chain will allow the free movement of businesses and users between online platforms, creating what we call a true virtual society.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are building Somnia, a fast and cost-effective EVM-based blockchain, to achieve this. Somnia is a layer-one blockchain with full EVM compatibility, capable of processing over 400,000 transactions per second with sub-second latency and low fees.

Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They donât spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and donât read many traditional textbooks â instead, theyâre building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community.Weâve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams.

We believe blockchain technology is a cornerstone for the future of new, open Internet applications.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, there are limits to what you can build on-chain. Many factors constrain this, from the cost of running applications to the fundamental performance limitations of existing blockchains. We believe that new technologies can unlock a new class of real-time applications that normally must be built on Web2 foundations. Enabling these systems to be built on-chain will allow the free movement of businesses and users between online platforms, creating what we call a true virtual society.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are building Somnia, a fast and cost-effective EVM-based blockchain, to achieve this. Somnia is a layer-one blockchain with full EVM compatibility, capable of processing over 400,000 transactions per second with sub-second latency and low fees. This will unlock a new wave of on-chain applications. Initially, we are focusing on gaming, metaverse, and social experiences. But we are not even 100% certain of what can be built with the technology we are creating.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Somnia is being developed by<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.virtualsociety.foundation\"> <u>Virtual Society Foundation</u></a>, an independent organisation initiated by<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.improbable.io/\"> <u>Improbable</u></a>, a British start-up that has been at the forefront of building virtual worlds for over a decade.

No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things theyâve always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They donât spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and donât read many traditional textbooks â instead, theyâre building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community.Weâve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams.
